### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Aris and this is my GitHub profile. I am an engineering PhD with a passion for programming.
I spend a lot of my free time developing my software engineering skills by working on various software projects, primarily in C#/C++.
My GitHub profile highlights some of the projects and tools that I have developed over the years.

I am currently working full time as a test software developer using C# and .NET Framework.
In my free time I work on side projects using C# and Unity Game Engine.
